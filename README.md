## Description:
In media project, the real situation is a little bit difference from our imagine scence,
<br>so it's very necessary for developers to design and make interface in back front screen,
<br>which can conveninent to control and make sure client have a good experince in our art works,
<br>"SaverUse" is coming, not only can we save the data from which we chose cutomize interface 
<br>but also can encrypt out the contents of any COMP referening an external.tox!

## Functionality
- **AddComp**
  - It can add row before combining any panels in SaverUse. 
- **RemoveAll**
  - Destroy all the row about refencing panels
- **Save**
  - Save whole project and external.tox those have changed.
- **Encrypt**
  - Prevent other people from roading external.tox in other file.

## Issue Known:
- It can't load the list of parameter in EngineComp.
- The plugin only can work for referring parameters to as interface instead of panels as interface.
- The buttons of the **AddComp** and **RemoveAll** position are not correctly.
- **RemoveAll** button doesn't remove all COMP rows at once.
